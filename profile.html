    <h3 class="titles" >A Little Bit About Me</h3>
    <p class="info"> I'm a 1st year electrical engineering major at Georgia Tech, and I'm from Irvine, California. This is my first time living in Atlanta, Georgia and I have to say that the city is very nice. As an electrical engineer, I am pursuing the threads for signal and information processing and circuit design, and I really enjoy coding during my free time! (Considering switching to computerscience:))</p>
    <h3 class="titles"> My Family </h3> 
    <p class="info"> I'm the youngest in my family of four (including my dog). In my family are my parents, my brother, and my dog named Bell. My parents are currently in California, and my brother is currently in Pittsburg studying data science at Carnegie Mellon University. The picture below shows my parents and my brother! </p>
