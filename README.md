Replicated Google's home page and created a page introducing myself (HTML, CSS)

I replicated Google's home screen using HTML and CSS! Aditionally, I linked a 
seperate HTML page introducing myself, and this is accesible when users click 
the top right corner of the Google Home page on the "Profile" icon. I included
some cool features like alerts, typewriter-text effect, and links to my favorite 
games! Enjoy!
